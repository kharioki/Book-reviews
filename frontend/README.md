# MVP

A single product page that allows anyone to add reviews and see the average rating of a book.

The product page shows two components, one with the reviews added about the book and the other a form to add rating and review about the book.

This MVP project is built with HTML, vanilla JavaScript, and CSS.

The backend is a Node.js graphQL server that uses MongoDB to store the data.
