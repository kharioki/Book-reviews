# Book-reviews

A single product page that allows anyone to add reviews and see the average rating of a product.

This project has two releases:

## Release 1 - MVP

This MVP project is built with HTML, vanilla JavaScript, and CSS.

The backend is a Node.js graphQL server that uses MongoDB to store the data.

## Release 2 - V2

The V2 release is built with React.js, Apollo Client, and GraphQL.

It also connects to a backend that uses MongoDB to store the data and a graphql-yoga server.

V2 also includes:

- subscriptions to the backend to update the frontend when a review is added.
- support for half-star ratings.
- mobile-first responsive design.
